# 🧗‍♂️ SOL Climber

A brutal survival mountain climbing game on the Solana blockchain.

Climb higher, loot on-chain NFTs, and survive or fall to your death and leave your gear behind for others to mint. Every step is risk.

Every item is real. Every death writes a story to the chain.

## 🚀 Game Overview

- A climbing survival game where players can **choose different mountains**, each with unique difficulty and environmental hazards.
- Players must **prepare equipment and supplies** before starting a climb.
- During the climb, two main stats affect survival:
  - **HP**: Restored using first aid kits.
  - **Stamina**: Replenished by consuming food or water.
- Players must **travel from the base to the summit**.  
  Along the way, **Checkpoints** allow players to rest and recover stamina.  
  However, **death resets the run** back to the base, and **all consumables** (food, water, first aid kits) are **dropped on-site** for others to loot.
- **P2P item trading** is available during climbs, players can trade food, water, and first aid kits with each other using **SOL** or **barter trades**.
- Reaching the summit rewards players with **NFTs** of varying rarity depending on the mountain, including:
  - clothes, pants, boots, trekking poles, and more.
  - These can be listed and sold on the **marketplace** for SOL.
- The game is **CO-OP based**, players can climb together, help each other, or leave each other behind.
- All in-game items are **NFTs stored on-chain (Solana)**.
- There’s a **player marketplace** to list dropped items and earn **real SOL**, with a small transaction fee serving as the game’s revenue.
- An **official game store** is available to purchase basic supplies like water, food, and first aid kits.
- **Player stats** such as:
  - number of successful summits,
  - safe returns,
  - and number of deaths  
    are **recorded permanently on the blockchain**.

> Climb high. Trade smart. Survive the mountain or become loot.
